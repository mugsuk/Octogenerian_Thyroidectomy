# Provox TOF leakage

### Introduction:

- 20–30 % of all patients with voice prostheses develop periprosthetic leakage
  - substantial enlargement of the TOF which required multiple treatments occurred in 12.5 % of the patients.

##### Valves:

- Provox I and II, and the VEGA prosthesis have an outer diameter of 7.5 mm in the region of the shaft
- Blom-Singer prosthesis [available in two outer diameter sizes, 20 French (6.7 mm) and 16 French (5.3 mm)], have smaller inner diameters.

The larger inner diameter of the Provox prosthesis is associated with lower airflow resistance so that this type of prosthesis requires less effort in voicing
By contrast, smaller diameter valves are argued to have lower risk of periprosthetic leakage and fistula enlargement -- whether this is true is uncertain

_**prosthesis lifespan**_ is reported to range between 90 -- 250 days; Provox prostheses can be expected to last +/- 140 days

### Complications:

1. _**Extremely rare, but reported**_

- quadriplegia
- mediastinitis or severe soft tissue infection
- oesophageal stricture
- ileus following the ingestion of a prosthesis
- aspiration of a prosthesis, and severe soft-tissue infections

2. _**Minor, but Common**_

- valve crusting
- candidiasis
[both may cause valve flap dysfunction (transprosthetic leak), and stomal health problems (periprosthetic leak)]
- granulation (usually d/2 biofilm formation)
- scarring
[both can cause the prosthesis to protrude, fit poorly, or become dislodged; again, these may predispose to periprosthetic leakage]

#### Periprosthetic Leakage:

The two main causes of significant leak are **_dilated atrophic_**, or _**infected necrotic fistulas**_

1. Dilated atrophic fistulas
- characterised by atrophy of the membranous wall of the trachea including the musculature, the connective tissue and the mucosa
- this type of fistula enlargement usually occurs only several years
- these fistulas have a low tendency to shrink and are difficult to manage

2. Infected necrotic fistulas
- are associated with swelling in the region of the shunt which is caused by local infections, pressure necrosis from a prosthesis of insufficient length, or mechanical irritation
- the flanges cause local pressure on the mucosa >>> decrease in mucosal perfusion, and can eventually >>> necrosis in the region of the fistula
- these fistulas often have a large diameter, but can be successfully managed using anti-inflammatory and antibiotic treatment

##### Factors contributing to TOF problems include:

- Radiotherapy
- Prosthesis diameter and weight, or micro-movements
- Trauma during prosthesis replacement
- Reflux -- may contribute to the problem in as many as 77% of cases where granulation is o served
- Oesophageal stenosis/stricture >>> increased luminal pressure around the provox
- other:
  - nutritional status
  - DM
  - thyroid dysfunction

### Non-Surgical Management of TOF Leakage:

1. downsizing -- using a _**shorter valve**_ places a more snug flange fit on the oesophageal and trachealwalls
2. silicone collar around the valve to effectively increase the flange size (for details sees article)
  - long-term success rate of 42%
3. fistula shrinkage -- remove valve, place cuffed trache back in, and feed via NGT
  - monitor shrinkage (usually need 4 -- 6 weeks)
  - 50% effective on first go
  - particularly effective in hypertrophic/necrotic fistula enlargement since this type of fistula is associated with a tendency towards granulation tissue formation that contributes to a reduction in fistula size
  - is often unsuccessful in the treatment of dilated atrophic fistulas
4. fistula shrinkage by cautery -- to induce granulation and fibrosis
5. tissue augmentation (injections)
  - fat
  - Bioplastique
  - collagen
  - hyaluronic acid
  - calcium hydroxylapatite (Radiesse) -- absorbed into the tissue within 12–18 months and thus lasts approximately twice as long as hyaluronic products.
  - cymetra
  - granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM- CSF) -- to encourage formation of granulation tissue
    - have produced marked shrinkage, and even complete closure of large fistulae
6. botulinum injections
  - in pxs where oesophageal stenosis is associated with suspected cricopharyngeal hypertension, botox has successfully released pressure around the TOF, and stopped leakage

### Surgical Management of TOF Leakage:

employed if non-surgical attempts fail

1. purse-string suture -- seems to only work for a very short time and is not recommended
2. primary closure in layers -- may produce complete closure 50% of time (altho may be better if fistula is < 10mm in size)
3. interposition of autologous or xenogeneic material -- 2 layer closure, but place something between them (skin / fascia / surgicel)
4. interposition of pedicled local or distant flaps
5. free flaps such as jejunal interpositions or radial forearm flaps
6. tubed gastric pull-up
7. placement of coated tracheal stent -- cannot be removed, have a high propensity to form granulation tissue at the ends, and thus should be considered a last resort

staged treatment approach has proved effective;

once healed, wait 3 -- 4 months before performing secondary puncture
